Final-Project
=============

Final Project for DGMD E-15 using the BeagleBone Black

Topic: Home Automation and Security

I would like to build an application using the BeagleBone Black and javascript. I decided to explore a home automation and security project because we are currenly in the process of building a new home and I thought it would be good if this project could satisfy (as a minimum) the following requirements:
        1 - Garage Door Monitoring Capability: 
                - Detect and report if Garage Door is left open for more than 15-30 minutes (duration configurable). Reporting: email and/or text message to one or more registered email/text or a buzzer sound (not too alarming).
                - Capability to close door remotely - not sure if this can be done without a web hosting services or if it could initially be done using the localhost/home wifi.
    If time permits (and as a minimum allow for future expansion):            
        2 - outdoors surveillance camera(s)
        3 - monitor sprinkler system water usage - send email/text if sprinkler on for longer than expected (had problems in the past with small rocks in sprinkler head prevented shutdown)
        4 - basement flooding (if sump-pump stops working and water level exceeds danger zone).

        5 - 
        
Questions: 
        1 - will any of the remote notifications/control require web hosting services and server side programing (php / database for persistent storage). Could initial project rely on purely javascript and localhost/wifi with future extension to use web hosting for remote control/notification
        2 - besides the BeagleBone and sensors, and a wireless router,
